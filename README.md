# Team-A
Our proposal which is labeled TeamA's proposal will give the goals and purpose of this project
Hotel Reservations.csv is the raw dataset with the 18 predictors
MLDataset is the dataset that is used for the random forest model
Hotel_Reservations_finalclean is the dataset that is used to make the logarithmic model
We performed the basic feature selection on IDSC_project.ipynb and used that to get a basic idea of what predictors were significant
All of the data visualizations that were in the presentation were created in Data Visualizations.ipynb
The logarithmic model was created and tested in logarithmic regression algorithim.rmd
The random forest algorithm was created in Random_Forest_Algorithm.ipynb
