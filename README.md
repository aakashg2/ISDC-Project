# Forecasting the Future of Hotel Bookings
Project Vision: Create a model which holds the ability to accurately predict wheter a hotel reservation made by a customer will eventually be cancelled or not.

Motivation/Inspiration: 

Added Value:  Estimates from Forbes show that Hotels lose potentially an extra 30% in income from cancellations. We hope to reduce this number through our model.

# Methodology

PreProcessing/Cleaning: 

Research Questions:

1. How well can our predictors predict if a customer will cancel their booking or not? 

2. What are the important predictors that correlate strongly to our response?Â 

3. How can we use our selected predictors to optimize certain metrics?

# Conclusion

Through analysis, we have been able to create two models, a logistic and a random forest algorithm model. The logistic model prioritizes recall while the random forest algorithm has a slightly lower recall but far more accuracy. Clients that use our models can decide which best suits their companiy's needs and use them accordingly.
